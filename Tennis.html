            <p>Tennis is a racquet sport played by two or four players on a rectangular court divided by a net. Players use their racquets to hit a small, 
                light ball back and forth over the net, with the goal of making it difficult for their opponent to return the ball. 
                Points are scored when one player fails to return the ball within the designated boundaries of the court. Tennis requires both physical and mental agility, 
                as well as strategy and quick reflexes. It can be played competitively at all levels, from amateur to professional, and is popular worldwide. 
                Tennis also has a rich history and culture, with famous players and tournaments that have become legendary in the sport's lore.</p>

            <p>Tennis, one of the most popular sports in the world, has a rich history dating back to 12th century France. The game was originally called "Jeu de Paume," 
                meaning "game of the palm," and was played indoors with the hand instead of a racket. Over time, players began to use gloves and then wooden paddles to hit the ball. 
                In the 16th century, rackets were introduced and the game became known as "real tennis." 
                It wasn't until the late 19th century that modern lawn tennis was developed by British army officer Walter Clopton Wingfield. 
                The first Wimbledon championship was held in 1877 and since then, tennis has become a beloved sport played by millions around the world.</p>

            <p>Tennis history is filled with legendary players who have left an indelible mark on the sport. From the likes of Bill Tilden and Don Budge to Rod Laver and Bjorn Borg, 
                each era has produced its own share of champions. The modern era has seen the rise of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, and Serena Williams, 
                all of whom have cemented their place in tennis history with their incredible achievements. Each player brought their unique style to the court, 
                making tennis a beautiful and dynamic game to watch. With so many greats having graced the courts over the years, 
                it's impossible to pick just one as the greatest of all time. 
                But what is certain is that these players have inspired generations of young athletes to pursue their dreams on the tennis court.</p>
